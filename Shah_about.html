            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>I am a programmer and student with a goal of crafting solutions to complex problems throughout my career. I aim to make an impact on the world to change it for the better, and my passion for programming allows me to create applications that can help people around the world. The internet acts as an outlet for my creations and ideas. My plan for achieving this goal is to pursue computer science throughout my education. I intend to take various introductory computer science courses along with AP Computer Science in high school. In the future, I plan to attend a university to obtain a Bachelor of Computer Science. Additionally, I will attend a graduate school to pursue a Master of Computer Science. Throughout college, I will take a variety of other courses relating to business and design to learn more on how to launch a product while gaining experience in doing so.</p>
            <p>When working on projects, I am a flexible and knowledgeable individual capable of being a leader. When faced with obstacles, I am able to think outside of the box using previous experience and knowledge to overcome them. I am able to take other ideas into consideration and help lead a team to come to a consensus. In teams, I take the role of the leader and organize the ideas of others while contributing some of my own. When unpredictable events or roadblocks come in the way of a project, I am able to adapt and improvise to ensure that it continues. The combination of my experience, leadership, and flexibility allow me to produce polished applications efficiently.</p>
            <p>Throughout my school career I was able to teach myself how to program and create applications using a variety of methods. I am constantly learning as the field of computer science rapidly changes, and I have created and launched a diverse set of products from scratch. My projects have been featured in a wide array of outlets and have received press. The popularity of my projects have led to many new opportunities; these include internships, job offers, and interviews. For example, I created Moon, a JavaScript user interface compiler to assist other web developers in creating powerful applications. It has received over 4,000 stars on GitHub and has attracted a community of people using it in production. Additionally, I created Wade, a text-search algorithm and implementation to help developers add a search feature with ease. It has gotten attention from plenty of developers in the community, and opened up an internship for me with Google. My projects have also gave me the chance to be interviewed and featured as a maker on Enlight.</p>
            <p>Thank you for learning about my experience and goals for the future. I hope to help create new applications that solve important problems in society today. Learn more about my projects here, contact me here, and my resume is available here.</p>
