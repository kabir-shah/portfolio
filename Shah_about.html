			<h1>About</h1>
			<div class="about-portrait"></div>
			<p>I am a programmer and student with a goal of solving major world problems to improve lives. From online shopping to maintaining a rocket’s trajectory, computers allow humans to simplify the complex. This potential for solving problems is what drives my passion for programming. By pursuing a career in computer science, I will be at the forefront of advancement. To get there, I hope to attend a four-year university, ideally in California, to earn a Master of Computer Science. Why computer science? Because although the design of computers themselves is important, they are only what you make of them; software focuses on what computers do, not how they work. Armed with this knowledge, I want to work on companies: the kind that solve problems and help people. Whether they are my own companies or others like NASA or Google, it does not matter. As long as they try to solve problems, I can apply my software development skills to make computers do it for them.</p>
			<p>On projects, I typically focus on the conceptual side of designs. My strengths come into play when focusing on theory and architecture rather than implementation details. In teams, I excel when it comes to bringing new ideas to the table or improving on other ideas. Afterwards, I create and allocate tasks to realize the idea among the team according to each member’s strengths and weaknesses. Similarly, when facing challenges with the design, I am quick to come up with solutions and keeping the team under control. For example, in my Principles of Engineering class, my team and I had a project to implement a compound machine. The project was due soon, and we had just realized that we did not have four unique simple machines to meet the design requirements. Rather than panicking, I quickly suggested that we move a wheel to a new location and repurpose it as a pulley, thereby meeting the requirements.</p>
			<p>During high school, I have worked on countless projects, both for school and on the side. For example, I participated in the annual entrepreneurship project for my Computer Science Principles class. With my team, I worked on creating <a href="https://conode.co">Conode</a>, a web application that helps people find like-minded teammates to collaborate with. At the time, it was nearing finals week and deep into lacrosse season, leaving me with very little time. Still, we persevered through the long nights and presented multiple times, winning in all three classes we presented in and eventually winning “Most Polished Product” at the showcase. Outside of school, I’ve worked on <a href="https://kbrsh.github.io/moon">Moon</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kbrsh/wade">Wade</a>. Moon is a programming library that allows developers to create web applications with purely functional programming. Wade is a text-search library that uses a novel algorithm for ranking results by relevance. They have received over 6,000 combined stars on GitHub and have been featured in press throughout the internet. I love working on side projects like these in my free time. They provide an endless stream of opportunities; these include internships, interviews, and meeting some very interesting people. Currently, I am an intern at <a href="https://withcompound.com">Compound</a>, creating web applications that help job candidates and recruiters evaluate their equity options. With these projects, I have deepened my knowledge on the web, JavaScript, servers, databases, and working with teams on large codebases.</p>
			<p>Thank you for learning about my experience and goals for the future. I hope to create new applications that solve important problems in society today. My resume is available <a href="./resume.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
