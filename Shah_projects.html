                    <h3>Image Manipulation Project</h3>
                    <p class="project-date">Computer Science Principles, February 2019 - March 2019</p>
                    <p>The goal of this project was to make software that manipulates input images in some way that is beneficial to a developer client looking for different ways to transform images. As a result, my partner and I for this project brainstormed “The Transformer”, a general tool that comes with predefined transformations on images and is easily extensible to allow for more. We came up with a list of potential transformations, including converting images to the style of Vincent Van Gogh, converting images to images made up of Minecraft blocks, and making pixel art from images. My role in the project was to develop the transform that turns landscape images into paintings in the style of Vincent Van Gogh. To get started, I looked into artificial intelligence techniques and learned a lot about Generative Adversarial Networks. I created my own implementation of one in Python using the Numpy, Keras, and Tensorflow libraries. One challenge that I faced was implementing the model and optimizing hyperparameters for it. I had a lot of trouble when dimensions didn’t work out because of the 5 dimensional matrices that I was working with, but eventually got it after researching convolutional neural networks and understanding how they work. Teamwork was required in this project, as the project wouldn’t be called the Transformer without the Minecraft transform created by my partner. I took the lead in the project and created most of the documentation, and, in addition, I distributed roles and tasks between me and my partner to get our modules connected and working together in the end. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MaI1DpJERdaTouCvTOqY1hN517CszZY_LNuninZZ4yg/edit?usp=sharing">View the documentation to learn more.</a></p>

                    <h3>Scratch Project</h3>
                    <p class="project-date">Computer Science Principles, August 2018 - September 2018</p>
                    <p>The goal of this project was to make a game that progressively increases in difficulty and is fun to play for a user. My partner and I decided to create a game called “The Floor is Lava”, a game that infinitely increases in difficulty using various techniques in order to capture and preserve the attention of the user. My role in the project was both planning and programming. Every work day consisted of partner programming where one person would give a design for the structure of a program, while another would implement it using code. We were able to propose different ideas to solve problems, and worked with each other to find an efficient solution. I learned how to use Scratch to create games, and how to partner program effectively to create a polished final product. We had to overcome various challenges while creating the game. For example, characters occasionally fell through blocks due to the faulty default collision detection. As a result, my partner and I devised a manual collision detection method. Teamwork was crucial to this project, and I was able to develop skills in working collaboratively on programming projects instead of working solo. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e__sv5DujcnHxJJ6w3m5Oh_jeHOhvj9lDsHWcRxEb50/edit?usp=sharing">View the documentation to learn more.</a></p>
