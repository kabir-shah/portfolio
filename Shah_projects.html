                    <h3>Compound Machine Project</h3>
                    <p class="project-date">Principles of Engineering, August 2019 - September 2019</p>
                    <p>The goal of this project was to create a compound machine that would be useful to an alien species. My team and I discovered a potential problem that they might have faced: climbing up a slide on a playground after riding it. It can be hard to climb slides repeatedly after riding down them, and it can ruin the fun of the moment as one uses a significant amount of energy to climb back up the slide. As a result, we designed a compound machine that could solve the problem. The machine works by having a wheel that a user can spin, whether it be a parent or even the person riding the slide. This wheel drives an axle, which drives gears in a simple gear train, which then spins a pulley. The string attached to the pulley should also be attached to the person sliding down the “Infinity Slide”, and it will then pull them up the slide, which acts as an inclined plane. My role in the project involved designing the original idea and implementing it using VEX parts. Specifically, I created the original sketches and designed the way the different simple machines would interact with each other to create a functioning compound machine. After the conceptual portion was finished, I worked with other members of the team to create the gear train, the wheel and axle, and the pulley. We initially started by splitting up into smaller pairs within the team who would each implement two simple machines. After working with a teammate to create the gear train and wheel and axle machines, I worked with my team to connect the parts into a functioning machine. However, we ran into an obstacle when attaching the “pulley” — when attaching it, we realized that it was resembling a wheel more than a pulley, as it did not change direction but simply winded up a string. This meant that we did not meet the constraint of having four simple machines, and we were also under a time restriction as we had one more day to work on it. As a result, I took the lead and suggested moving the pulley below the base of the gear train so that it will change the direction of the string and act as a true pulley. Also, I was able to delve deeper into mechanical engineering, an area I have an interest in but have not yet explored thoroughly; I learned about mechanical advantage and the design process behind compound machines. In the end, my teammates and I worked well together using a well-organized strategy, and I was able to demonstrate leadership and quick-thinking when we came across an unexpected challenge. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eqwfr13zEHkuFWLmAfmA26uI9cKXycFBUFmCrXjEn94/edit?usp=sharing">View the documentation to learn more.</a></p>

                    <h3>Image Manipulation Project</h3>
                    <p class="project-date">Computer Science Principles, February 2019 - March 2019</p>
                    <p>The goal of this project was to make software that manipulates input images in some way that is beneficial to a developer client looking for different ways to transform images. As a result, my partner and I for this project brainstormed “The Transformer”, a general tool that comes with predefined transformations on images and is easily extensible to allow for more. We came up with a list of potential transformations, including converting images to the style of Vincent Van Gogh, converting images to images made up of Minecraft blocks, and making pixel art from images. My role in the project was to develop the transform that turns landscape images into paintings in the style of Vincent Van Gogh. To get started, I looked into artificial intelligence techniques and learned a lot about Generative Adversarial Networks. I created my own implementation of one in Python using the Numpy, Keras, and Tensorflow libraries. One challenge that I faced was implementing the model and optimizing hyperparameters for it. I had a lot of trouble when dimensions didn’t work out because of the 5 dimensional matrices that I was working with, but eventually got it after researching convolutional neural networks and understanding how they work. Teamwork was required in this project, as the project wouldn’t be called the Transformer without the Minecraft transform created by my partner. I took the lead in the project and created most of the documentation, and, in addition, I distributed roles and tasks between me and my partner to get our modules connected and working together in the end. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13wYG18P2NYIi_PGDrgQmSY7dYRZlRX-B2qSr_Qr5CoM/edit?usp=sharing">View the documentation to learn more.</a></p>

                    <h3>Scratch Project</h3>
                    <p class="project-date">Computer Science Principles, August 2018 - September 2018</p>
                    <p>The goal of this project was to make a game that progressively increases in difficulty and is fun to play for a user. My partner and I decided to create a game called “The Floor is Lava”, a game that infinitely increases in difficulty using various techniques in order to capture and preserve the attention of the user. My role in the project was both planning and programming. Every work day consisted of partner programming where one person would give a design for the structure of a program, while another would implement it using code. We were able to propose different ideas to solve problems, and worked with each other to find an efficient solution. I learned how to use Scratch to create games, and how to partner program effectively to create a polished final product. We had to overcome various challenges while creating the game. For example, characters occasionally fell through blocks due to the faulty default collision detection. As a result, my partner and I devised a manual collision detection method. Teamwork was crucial to this project, and I was able to develop skills in working collaboratively on programming projects instead of working solo. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dcdBwFx2ppOLvU_EoCNaKrQXJRb5UuRty-K9wvpdNXs/edit?usp=sharing">View the documentation to learn more.</a></p>
