                    <h3>Scratch Project</h3>
                    <p class="project-date">Computer Science Principles, August 2018 - September 2018</p>
                    <p>The goal of this project was to make a game that progressively increases in difficulty and is fun to play for a user. My partner and I decided to create a game called “The Floor is Lava”, a game that infinitely increases in difficulty using various techniques in order to capture and preserve the attention of the user. My role in the project was both planning and programming. Every work day consisted of partner programming where one person would give a design for the structure of a program, while another would implement it using code. We were able to propose different ideas to solve problems, and worked with each other to find an efficient solution. I learned how to use Scratch to create games, and how to partner program effectively to create a polished final product. We had to overcome various challenges while creating the game. For example, characters occasionally fell through blocks due to the faulty default collision detection. As a result, my partner and I devised a manual collision detection method. Teamwork was crucial to this project, and I was able to develop skills in working collaboratively on programming projects instead of working solo.</p>
