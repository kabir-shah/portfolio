			<h1>Work Experience</h1>
			<h3><a href="./resume.pdf" target="_blank">Resumé</a></h3>
			<p>As a part of the engineering academy, I’ve had many opportunities to learn about practical engineering in the industry by attending field trips and meeting guest speakers. On my first field trip, we visited the Patriots Jet Team base. The Patriots Jet Team are a team of people that fly jets in air shows around the U.S. It was very interesting to be able to see the hangar and the jets inside of it. A few members of the team who had flown the jets before and worked there guided us throughout the hangar, describing specific parts of each plane. Every plane was unique and had features specific to it to make it as aerodynamic and efficient as possible. We also learned about satellites and how they orbit in various conic shapes. The whole experience was captivating, and it sparked my interest in aerospace engineering. The stories from the professionals onsite were incredible — each one was unique and filled with action. They were constantly improving designs and flying jets, showing how the field was rich with variety. It was useful to learn about how engineers design redundant systems for safety and incorporate unique takes on traditional aeroplane designs to optimize for aerodynamics, and I would love to explore the field of aerospace engineering further.</p>
			<p>Throughout the year, we’ve listened to many guest speakers, each one bringing their experience and stories to give us an idea of their respective industry and career. I found one speaker particularly interesting: Maynard Holliday. He is a renowned engineer known for helping to build a robot to investigate the nuclear meltdown at Chernobyl. Even though we were all engineering students and had been exposed to the engineering design process in our projects, we had never really seen how this process is applied outside of the classroom on a more practical level. Maynard Holliday brought us all to his world and told us his stories, and surprisingly, we could identify many of the same processes that we learned in the classroom, albeit at higher scales and complexities. It was mesmerizing to hear about how cooling water stopped flowing, causing overheating and an explosion to blow off the top of the reactor. This was entirely unexplored territory, and something new would have to be designed to explore the space. We learned about the design process that went into the robot and the variables it had to account for. Specifically, they were constrained to an environment with high levels of radiation which could harm the hardware and software, and they needed to use various sensors to maneuver the robot because of low visibility and the high amount of unknowns in the Chernobyl plant. I was already interested in robots before, but this only solidified that interest. He showed us how every robot he designed was unique and optimized for specific purposes, but usually inspired by biology for movement. This sort of natural movement was very hard to design manually, and it was interesting to learn about the process behind it. All in all, I learned a lot about robotics and engineering, and I loved how every project was unique and required novel designs to tackle problems that had never been seen before.</p>
