         <h1>Work Experience</h1>
         <p>
            As a part of the engineering academy, I’ve had many opportunities to
            learn about practical engineering in the industry by attending field
            trips and meeting guest speakers. On my first field trip, we visited
            the Patriots Jet Team base. The Patriots Jet Team are a team of
            people that fly jets in air shows around the U.S. It was very
            interesting to be able to see the hangar and the jets inside of it.
            A few members of the team who had flown the jets before and worked
            there guided us throughout the hangar, describing specific parts of
            each plane. Every plane was unique and had features specific to it
            to make it as aerodynamic and efficient as possible. We also learned
            about satellites and how they orbit in various conic shapes. The
            whole experience was captivating, and it sparked my interest in
            aerospace engineering. The stories from the professionals onsite
            were incredible — each one was unique and filled with action. They
            were constantly improving designs and flying jets, showing how the
            field was rich with variety. It was useful to learn about how
            engineers design redundant systems for safety and incorporate unique
            takes on traditional aeroplane designs to optimize for aerodynamics,
            and I would love to explore the field of aerospace engineering
            further.
         </p>
         <p>
            Another field trip I was able to attend was the Livermore Aviation
            virtual tour with Robot Garden, New Frontier Aerospace, and Five
            Rivers Aviation. This was an interesting experience where I was able
            to learn about the daily operations of an airport. I learned about
            how engineers operate airplanes and ensure that they have a safe
            flight. It was especially interesting to see a video of them flying
            a plane and pointing out the different tools and gauges on the
            plane.
         </p>
         <p>
            In addition, I attended Berkeley EECS day to learn about UC
            Berkeley’s Electrical Engineering and Computer Science program. It
            was an insightful experience where I was able to gain hands-on
            experience with two different fields of engineering and learn how
            they interact with each other. We were able to work through data
            science labs and experiment with basic circuits, and it was a great
            glimpse into the way that research is conducted in universities.
         </p>
         <p>
            Lastly, I attended the virtual JA Entrepreneurship Summit. Here, I
            was able to see different guest speakers talk about aspects of
            Amazon Web Services and how it is used to power key parts of the
            internet. They covered information about the infrastructure and
            planning that goes into making large, scalable services. Many of
            these problems are often solved through distributed systems that
            people can easily overlook until they fail, so it was very
            insightful to see this part of software engineering deconstructed.

            Throughout the year, we’ve listened to many guest speakers, each one
            bringing their experience and stories to give us an idea of their
            respective industry and career. I found one speaker particularly
            interesting: Maynard Holliday. He is a renowned engineer known for
            helping to build a robot to investigate the nuclear meltdown at
            Chernobyl. Even though we were all engineering students and had been
            exposed to the engineering design process in our projects, we had
            never really seen how this process is applied outside of the
            classroom on a more practical level. Maynard Holliday brought us all
            to his world and told us his stories, and surprisingly, we could
            identify many of the same processes that we learned in the
            classroom, albeit at higher scales and complexities. It was
            mesmerizing to hear about how cooling water stopped flowing, causing
            overheating and an explosion to blow off the top of the reactor.
            This was entirely unexplored territory, and something new would have
            to be designed to explore the space. We learned about the design
            process that went into the robot and the variables it had to account
            for. Specifically, they were constrained to an environment with high
            levels of radiation which could harm the hardware and software, and
            they needed to use various sensors to maneuver the robot because of
            low visibility and the high amount of unknowns in the Chernobyl
            plant. I was already interested in robots before, but this only
            solidified that interest. He showed us how every robot he designed
            was unique and optimized for specific purposes, but usually inspired
            by biology for movement. This sort of natural movement was very hard
            to design manually, and it was interesting to learn about the
            process behind it. All in all, I learned a lot about robotics and
            engineering, and I loved how every project was unique and required
            novel designs to tackle problems that had never been seen before.

            Another guest speaker I found interesting was Jason Yosinski, an AI
            engineer at Uber. He introduced us to AI being used at scale for
            self-driving cars. He talked about convolutional neural networks and
            how they are used in computer vision. He dove into the layers of the
            neural network and how each of them were able to identify different
            features. As they combined and formed a “deep” neural network, they
            were able to identify increasingly complex features and be used in
            more complex applications such as self-driving cars.
         </p>
         <p>
            Ganesh Datta was another guest speaker I had the pleasure of
            listening to. He spoke about the intersection between engineering
            and entrepreneurship. Specifically, he talked about important and
            practical questions to consider when bringing a product to the
            market. I learned about product-market fit, finding investors, and
            the overall engineering design process.
         </p>
         <p>
            In addition, I attended the guest talk by Donald James,
            administrator at NASA and author of “Manners Will Take You Where
            Brains and Money Won't”. He talked about his experience in finding a
            successful career in NASA and gave extremely valuable advice on what
            helped him the most. In brief, the importance of good manners and
            people skills is highly overlooked, and I learned that it is crucial
            to have them in order to succeed.
         </p>

            During my junior year, I was given the opportunity to be a part of
            the mentorship program. My mentor was Girish Krishna, senior
            director at Cognizant. He guided me throughout the year and gave
            many pieces of valuable advice in the process. I learned about
            tackling behavioral interviews by not being afraid to ask questions,
            crafting the perfect resume for different positions, and creating
            SMART goals.
